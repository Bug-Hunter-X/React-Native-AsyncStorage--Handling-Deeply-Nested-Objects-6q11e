This React Native code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to using AsyncStorage with a deeply nested object.  The issue arises when attempting to store and retrieve a complex object containing multiple levels of nesting.  Directly storing and retrieving such objects can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly data corruption or type conversion issues.  This example highlights the problem and provides a solution using JSON.stringify and JSON.parse for serialization and deserialization.
